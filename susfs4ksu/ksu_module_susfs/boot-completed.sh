#### Hide the mmapped real file from various maps in /proc/self/ ####

## - Please note that it is better to do it in boot-completed starge
##   Since some target path may be mounted by ksu, and make sure the
##   target path has the same dev number as the one in global mnt ns,
##   otherwise the sus map flag won't be seen on the umounted process.
## - To debug with this, users can do this in a root shell:
##   1. Find the pid and uid of a opened umounted app by running
##      ps -enf | grep myapp
##   2. cat /proc/<pid_of_myapp>/maps | grep "<added/sus_map/path>"'
##   3. In other root shell, run
##      cat /proc/1/mountinfo | grep "<added/sus_map/path>"'
##   4. Finally compare the dev number with both output and see if they are consistent,
##      if so, then it should be working, but if not, then the added sus_map path
##      is probably not working, and you have to find out which mnt ns the dev number
##      from step 2 belongs to, and add the path from that mnt ns:
##         busybox nsenter -t <pid_of_mnt_ns_the_target_dev_number_belongs_to> -m ksu_susfs add_sus_map <target_path>
